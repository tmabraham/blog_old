    "**TL;DR:** We introduce a dataset, Noisy Imagenette, which is a version of the Imagenette dataset with noisy labels. We hope this dataset is useful for rapid experimentation and testing of methods to address noisy label training.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Introduction\n",
    "Deep learning has led to impressive results on datasets of all types, but its success often shines when models are trained with large datasets with human-annotated labels (extreme example: GPT-3 and more recently CLIP/ALIGN/DALL-E). A major challenge when constructing these datasets is obtaining enough labels to train a neural network model. There is an inherent tradeoff between the quality of the annotations and the cost of annotation (in the form of time or money). For example, while using sources like Amazon Mechanical Turk provide cheap labeling, the use of these non-expert labeling services will often produce unreliable labels. This is what is referred to as noisy labels, as these unreliable labels are not necessarily ground truth. Unfortunately, neural networks are known to be susceptible to overfitting to noisy labels (see [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03530)) which means alternative approaches are needed to achieve good generalization in the presence of noisy labels.\n",
    " \n",
    " Recently, many techniques have been presented in order to address label noise. These include novel loss functions like [Bi-Tempered Logistic Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03361)[Taylor Cross Entropy Loss](https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/2020/305), or [Symmetric Cross Entropy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.06112). Additionally, there are many novel training techniques that have been recently developed like [MentorMix](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09781), [DivideMix](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07394), [Early-Learning Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00151) and [Noise-Robust Contrastive Learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=D1E1h-K3jso). \n",
    " \n",
    " Most of these papers are using MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR10 or related datasets with synthetically-added noise. Other common datasets are the WebVision and Clothing1M datasets, which are real-world noisy, large-scale datasets with millions of images. Therefore there is an opportunity to develop a mid-scale dataset that allows for rapid prototyping but is complex enough to provide useful results when it comes to noisy label training.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of mid-scale datasets for rapid prototyping has been explored in the past. For example, in 2019, fast.ai [released](https://github.com/fastai/imagenette) the Imagenette and Imagewoof datasets (subsequently updated in 2020), subsets of Imagenet for rapid experimentation and prototyping. It can serve as a small dataset proxy for the ImageNet, or a dataset with more complexity than MNIST or CIFAR10 but still small and simple enough for benchmarking and rapid experimentation. This dataset has been used to test and establish new training techniques like [Mish activation function](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08681) and [Ranger optimizer](https://forums.fast.ai/t/meet-ranger-radam-lookahead-optimizer/52886) (see [here](https://forums.fast.ai/t/how-we-beat-the-5-epoch-imagewoof-leaderboard-score-some-new-techniques-to-consider/53453)). The dataset also has been used in various papers (see [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07629), [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15248), [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04887), [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.06639), [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05624), and [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1047320321000134?casa_token=uL4_SoQQgKsAAAAA:CPGu3HeZVciBO5YEocTnziH7YVhbcGF0JCpB0JuJi2pqHmkaAKibhaVYe-3t07nxtpdem2lv)). Clearly, this dataset has been quite useful to machine learning researchers and practitioners for testing and comparing new methods. We believe that an analogous dataset could be useful to researchers with modest compute for testing and comparing new methods for addressing label noise.\n"

    "# Backstory\n",
    "For some background, I started looking into training with label noise because of the recent Cassava Leaf Disease Kaggle Competition (my team was able win a silver medal, see [here](https://twitter.com/iScienceLuvr/status/1362879523650330627)), which had a really noisy dataset. One of the recent techniques I heard about was [SAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01412), which recently achieved a state-of-the-art score on ImageNet (only to be beaten in a few weeks by techniques/models like Meta Pseudo Labels and NFNets). However, the paper also included some improvements to noisy label training. I had a fastai implementation in-progress for the SAM optimizer (probably will describe in an upcoming blog post) and I wanted to test out its noisy label training capabilities on a dataset. I thought about corrupting the Imagenette labels and use that as my dataset for testing SAM. Jeremy Howard suggested adding it to the main Imagenette dataset and here we are!"
